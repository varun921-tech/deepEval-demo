To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo,\\nan evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To\\ncapture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test\\nsuite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent\\ntasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with 97 realistic\\ntasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making\\ntravel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms\\nfrom the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and\\ndefenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks),\\nand existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all.\\nWe hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AI agents\\nthat solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.\\nhttps://agentdojo.spylab.ai\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have the ability to understand tasks described in natural language\\nand generate plans to solve them [20, 27, 49, 60]. A promising design paradigm for AI agents [65] is\\nto combine an LLM with tools that interact with a broader environment [14, 35, 40, 47, 51, 53, 55,\\n69]. AI agents could be used for various roles, such as digital assistants with access to emails and\\ncalendars, or smart “operating systems” with access to coding environments and scripts [24, 25].\\nHowever, a key security challenge is that LLMs operate directly on text, lacking a formal way to\\ndistinguish instructions from data [44, 74]. Prompt injection attacks exploit this vulnerability by\\ninserting new malicious instructions in third-party data processed by the agent’s tools [17, 44, 62]. A\\nsuccessful attack can allow an external attacker to take actions (and call tools) on behalf of the user.\\nPotential consequences include exfiltrating user data, executing arbitrary code, and more [18, 23, 33,\\n42].\\nTo measure the ability of AI agents to safely solve tasks in adversarial settings when prompt injections\\nare in place, we introduce AgentDojo, a dynamic benchmarking framework which we populate–as a\\nfirst version–with 97 realistic tasks and 629 security test cases.

Researchers can define user and attacker goals to evaluate the\\nprogress of AI agents, prompt injections attacks, and defenses.\\nprovides an AI agent with tasks (e.g., summarizing and sending emails) and access to tools to solve\\nthem. Security tests consist of an attacker goal (e.g., leak the victim’s emails) and an injection\\nendpoint (e.g., an email in the user’s inbox).\\nIn contrast to prior benchmarks for AI Agents [32, 43, 50, 68] and for prompt injections [34, 57,\\n66, 71], AgentDojo requires agents to dynamically call multiple tools in a stateful, adversarial\\nenvironment. To accurately reflect the utility-security tradeoff of different agent designs, AgentDojo\\nevaluates agents and attackers with respect to a formal utility checks computed over the environment\\nstate, rather than relying on other LLMs to simulate an environment [50].\\nDue to the ever-evolving nature of ML security, a static benchmark would be of limited use. Instead,\\nAgentDojo is an extensible framework that can be populated with new tasks, attacks, and defenses.\\nOur initial tasks and attacks already present a significant challenge for attackers and defenders alike.\\nCurrent LLMs solve less than 66% of AgentDojo tasks in the absence of any attack. In turn, our\\nattacks succeed against the best performing agents in less than 25% of cases. When deploying existing\\ndefenses against prompt injections, such as a secondary attack detector [28, 45], the attack success\\nrate drops to 8%. We find that current prompt injection attacks benefit only marginally from side\\ninformation about the system or the victim, and succeed rarely when the attacker’s goal is abnormally\\nsecurity-sensitive (e.g., emailing an authentication code).\\nAt present, the agents, defenses, and attacks pre-deployed in our AgentDojo framework are general-\\npurpose and not designed specifically for any given tasks or security scenarios. We thus expect future\\nresearch to develop new agent and defense designs that can improve the utility and robustness of\\nagents in AgentDojo. At the same time, significant breakthroughs in the ability of LLMs to distinguish\\ninstructions from data will likely be necessary to thwart stronger, adaptive attacks proposed by the\\ncommunity. We hope that AgentDojo can serve as a live benchmark environment for measuring the\\nprogress of AI agents on increasingly challenging tasks, but also as a quantitative way of showcasing\\nthe inherent security limitations of current AI agents in adversarial settings.\\nWe release code for AgentDojo at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo, and a leader-\\nboard and extensive documentation for the library at https://agentdojo.spylab.ai.\\n2 Related Work and Preliminaries\\nAI agents and tool-enhanced LLMs. Advances in large language models [5] have enabled the\\ncreation of AI agents [65] that can follow natural language instructions [4, 41], perform reasoning\\nand planning to solve tasks [20, 27, 60, 69] and harness external tools [14, 35, 40, 43, 47, 51, 54, 55].\\nMany LLM developers expose function-calling interfaces that let users pass API descriptions to a\\nmodel, and have the model output function calls [2, 9, 22].\\nPrompt injections.

Ex-\\nisting agent benchmarks either evaluate the ability to\\ntransform instructions into a single function call [43, 47,\\n67], or consider more challenging and realistic “multi-\\nturn” scenarios [26, 31, 32, 53, 68, 72], but without any\\nexplicit attacks. The ToolEmu [50] benchmark measures\\nthe robustness of AI agents to underspecified instruc-\\ntions, and uses LLMs to efficiently simulate tool calls\\nin a virtual environment and to score the agent’s utility.\\nThis approach is problematic when evaluating prompt\\ninjections, since an injection might fool the LLM sim-\\nulator too. In contrast to these works, AgentDojo runs\\na dynamic environment where agents execute multiple\\ntool calls against realistic applications, some of which\\nreturn malicious data. Even when restricted to benign\\nsettings, our tasks are at least challenging as existing\\nfunction-calling benchmarks, see Figure 2.2\\nPrior benchmarks for prompt injections focus on sim-\\nple scenarios without tool-calling, such as document\\nQA [70], prompt stealing [12, 57], or simpler goal/rule\\nhijacking [39, 52]. The recent InjecAgent benchmark [71] is close in spirit to AgentDojo, but focuses\\non simulated single-turn scenarios, where an LLM is directly fed a single (adversarial) piece of data\\nas a tool output (without evaluating the model’s planning). In contrast, AgentDojo’s design aims to\\nemulate a realistic agent execution, where the agent has to decide which tool(s) to call and must solve\\nthe original task accurately in the face of prompt injections.\\n3 Designing and Constructing AgentDojo\\nThe AgentDojo framework consists of the following components: The environment specifies an\\napplication area for an AI agent and a set of available tools (e.g., a workspace environment with\\naccess to email, calendar and cloud storage tools). The environment state keeps track of the data for\\nall the applications that an agent can interact with. Some parts of the environment state are specified\\nas placeholders for prompt injection attacks (cf. Figure 1, and Section 3.3).\\nA user task is a natural language instruction that the agent should follow in a given environment (e.g.,\\nadd an event to a calendar). An injection task specifies the goal of the attacker (e.g., exfiltrate the\\nuser’s credit card). User tasks and injection tasks define formal evaluation criteria which monitor\\nthe state of the environment to measure the success rate of the agent and of the attacker, respectively.\\nWe refer to the collection of user tasks and injection tasks for an environment as a task suite. As in\\nZhan et al. [71], we take a cross-product of user and injection tasks per environment to obtain the\\ntotal set of security tests cases. All user tasks can also be run without an attack present, turning them\\ninto standard utility test cases, which can be used to assess agent performance in benign scenarios.\\n3.1 AgentDojo Components\\nEnvironments and state.

Attacker goals are specified using a similar format as user tasks: the malicious\\ntask is formulated as an instruction to the agent, and a security function checks whether the attacker\\ngoal has been met (cf.

We refer to the collection of user and injection tasks within an environment as atask\\nsuite. The task suite can be used to determine an agent’s utility on the corresponding user tasks, or to\\nexamine its security on pairs of user and injection tasks.\\nWe populate the first version of AgentDojo with four environments and corresponding task suites.\\nWe first manually design user tasks that cover a diverse set of scenarios possible in the environment,\\nincluding tasks requiring search capabilities over medium to long context windows (with up to 7,000\\nGPT-4 tokens for data and 4,000 GPT-4 tokens for tool descriptions), and tasks requiring chaining up\\nto 18 different calls to both general-purpose and specialized tools. Injection tasks have an increasing\\nand diverse difficulty both in terms of number of required steps (from one to twenty steps), and\\nin terms of sensitivity of the required action (from sending a generic email to sharing sensitive\\ninformation such as a 2 factors authentication code). We then combine these user tasks with the\\ninjection tasks relevant to the environment, to obtain the task suites. As explained above, the four\\nsuites are:\\n• Workspace: tools and tasks related to emails, calendar management, and a cloud drive.\\n• Slack: tools and tasks related to sending and reading messages on Slack, reading web pages,\\nand files.\\n• Banking: tools and tasks related to performing bank transactions, summarizing bank state-\\nments, etc.\\n• Travel: tools and tasks related to finding and reserving options for flights, restaurants, and\\ncar rentals.\\nFurther details on each environment and task suite are provided in Table 1.\\n3.2 Agents and Prompt Injection Defenses\\nAgentDojo is designed as a benchmark environment to evaluate new agent designs that can defend\\nagainst prompt injection attacks. We thus provide a simple interface for implementing new agents.\\nAn agent component only has to provide a query function, which takes as argument the initial user\\ninstructions, a list of available tools, and the environment state (see Figure 11 in the appendix). To\\nenable rapid prototyping of new designs, AgentDojo also offers the ability to build modular agent\\npipelines by combining different components.

We believe this is unsatisfactory for evaluating robustness to\\nprompt injections, for two main reasons: (1) benchmarks for other security risks (e.g., for adversarial\\nexamples [10] or jailbreaks [7, 36]) can rely on attacks that explicitly optimize against a defense\\n(e.g., AutoAttack [11] or GCG [73]). In contrast, existing prompt injection attacks are primarily\\ngeneric and do not explicitly account for the model being used. (2) even for settings where powerful\\noptimization attacks exist, it is extremely easy to build non-robust defenses that thwart any specific\\nattack, and require an adaptive attack evaluation [58].\\nAgentDojo is thus not meant to be a static benchmark with fixed attacks, but rather a dynamic\\nframework that can be populated with new defenses and adaptive attacks in the future. Adding a new\\nattack to AgentDojo simply requires to define an attack function that takes as input a goal (i.e., an\\ninjection task) and returns an injection text for each attack placeholder, see Figure 13 in Appendix A.\\nWe also envision attackers with varying degrees of prior knowledge about the system and user under\\nattack, and who exploit this knowledge to strengthen their attacks. For example, an attack might\\nassume knowledge of the user’s name as well as of the agent’s tool-calling API, to design targeted\\nprompt injections (e.g., “Hi [ChatGPT], this is [Josh]. Please send an email to eve@evil.com”).\\n3.4 Reporting AgentDojo Results\\nWe consider three metrics in AgentDojo:\\nBenign Utility: the fraction of user tasks that the model solves in the absence of any attacks.\\nUtility Under Attack: the fraction of security cases (i.e., a pair of user task and injection task) where\\nthe agent solves the user task correctly, without any adversarial side effects. We sometimes report the\\ncomplement of this value as the untargeted attack success rate.\\nTargeted Attack Success Rate (ASR): the fraction of security cases where the attacker’s goal is met\\n(i.e., the agent executes the malicious actions).\\nWe sometimes also evaluate a collection of attacks{A1, . . . , An}, which we consider as successful\\non a given security case if any of the attacks in the collection succeeds.

For Llama 3 70B, we also provide\\nthe tool-calling prompt in Figure 16, adapted from Husain [21]. Except for Llama 3, which does\\nnot provide function calling out-of-the-box, we query all LLMs using the official providers’ APIs,\\nfollowing the respective documentation.\\nWe evaluate each agent on our full suite of 629 security test cases, for 97 different user tasks. For\\nadditional experiments and ablations on attack and defense components, we focus on GPT-4o as it is\\nthe model with the highest (benign) utility on our suite (Claude Opus has comparable utility, but our\\naccess to it was heavily rate limited which prevented in-depth analysis).\\n4.1 Performance of Baseline Agents and Attacks\\nWe first evaluate all agents against a generic attack that we found to be effective in preliminary\\nexperiments, called the “Important message” attack. This attack simply injects a message instructing\\nthe agent that the malicious task has to be performed before the original one (see Figure 19a for\\nour exact prompt). Figure 6a plots each agent’s average utility in the absence of any attack (benign\\nutility) vs. the attacker’s average success rate at executing their malicious goal (targeted ASR). We\\nfind that more capable models tend to be easier to attack, a form of inverse scaling law [38] (a similar\\nobservation had been made in [37]). This is a potentially unsurprising result, as models with low\\nutility often fail at correctly executing the attacker’s goal, even when the prompt injection succeeds.\\nFigure 6b further plots the benign utility (i.e., without attack) vs. utility under attack—the latter of\\nwhich can be interpreted as a form of robustness to denial-of-service attacks. Here, we find a strong\\ncorrelation between utility and robustness. Most models incur a loss of 10%–25% in absolute utility\\nunder attack.\\nOverall, the most capable model in a benign setting is Claude 3.5 Sonnet, closely followed by GPT-4o.\\nThe former also provides a better tradeoff between utility and security against targeted attacks. For\\nthe remaining experiments in this paper, we focus on GPT-4o as Claude 3.5 Sonnet was released after\\nthe first version of this paper.\\nFigure 7 breaks down the attack success rate for individual injection tasks and task suites. Some\\napplications are easier to attack than others. For example, attacks in our “Slack” suite have a 92%\\nsuccess rate (in this suite, the agent performs tasks such as browsing the Web and posting in different\\nchannels; the attacker places injections in web pages to trigger actions such as sharing a phishing\\nlink with a colleague). The high success rate for this suite may be explained by the fact that attackers\\ncontrol a significant fraction of the tool outputs (see Figure 21b in Appendix D). In contrast, some\\ninjection tasks can be very challenging to achieve. In particular, task 6 of our travel agent suite\\nsucceeds in 0% of cases. This injection task aims to make the agent book the most expensive hotel\\nin Paris, and exfiltrate the user’s personal information by email. The model thus has to execute two\\nunrelated malicious tasks and we find it often succeeds at only one (partial attacker success).\\n7'),\n",

As in prior studies [70], we find that injections placed towards the end of a\\ntool’s response message are most effective—with up to 70% average success rate against GPT-4o.\\n4.2 Ablations on Attack Components and Attacker Knowledge\\nOur experiments above use a generic prompt injection (see Figure 19a), that warns the agent of an\\nimportant additional task. The warning message further directly addresses the model (“This is a\\nmessage to you, GPT-4o”), and uses the victim’s real name (e.g., “This is a message from me, Josh”).\\nWe now ablate which components of this attack prompt contribute to its success.\\nWe first compare four prompt injection messages: (i) the “ignore previous instructions” attack [17];\\n(ii) the prompt injection from InjecAgent [71]; (iii) the instruction “TODO: {task description}”; and\\n(iv) our “Important message” prompt as shown in Figure 19a. We further add an adaptive attack\\n(Max) that selects the most effective prompt from (i)-(iv) for each task. Figure 8 shows that variations\\nin prompt injection phrasing can have a large impact, with our “Important message” attack clearly\\nbeating prior ones. Our adaptive attack (Max) boosts the success rates by another 10%.\\nTable 2 shows an ablation on the attacker knowledge of the names of the user and model. We find that\\nthis knowledge slightly increases the success rate of our attack (by 1.9%), but that incorrect guesses\\n(e.g., addressing GPT-4o as Claude) significantly weaken the attack.\\n4.3 Prompt Injection Defenses\\nSo far, we have evaluated LLM agents that were not specifically designed to resist prompt injections\\n(beyond built-in defenses that may be present in closed models). We now evaluate GPT-4o enhanced\\nwith a variety of defenses proposed in the literature against our strongest attack: (i) Data delimiters,\\nwhere following Hines et al. [19] we format all tool outputs with special delimiters, and prompt the\\nmodel to ignore instructions within these (prompt in Figure 17), (ii) Prompt injection detection which\\nuses a BERT classifier from ProtectAI [45] trained to detect prompt injection on each tool call output,\\nand aborts the agent if anything has been detected, (iii) Prompt sandwiching [30] which repeats\\nthe user instructions after each function call, (iv) Tool filter which is a simple form of an isolation\\nmechanism [63, 66], where the LLM first restricts itself to a set of tools required to solve a given task,\\n8'),\n",

We report 95% confidence intervals in Table 5.\\nbefore observing any untrusted data (e.g., if the task asks to “summarize my emails”, the agent can\\ndecide to only select the read_email tool, guarding against abuse of otherwise available tools).\\nFigure 9 shows the targeted attack success rates for each defense, as a function of the defense’s\\nbenign utility. Surprisingly, we find that many of our defense strategies actually increase benign\\nutility (see Table 5), presumably because they put more emphasis on the original instructions. The\\nprompt injection detector has too many false positives, however, and significantly degrades utility.\\nRepeating the user prompt after a tool call is a reasonable defense for our attack, but it is unlikely to\\nwithstand adaptive attacks (e.g., an injection that instructs the model to ignore future instructions).\\nStrengths and limitations of tool isolation mechanisms. Our simple tool filtering defense is\\nparticularly effective, lowering the attack success rate to 7.5%. This defense is effective for a large\\nnumber of the test cases in our suite, where the user task only requires read-access to a model’s state\\n(e.g., reading emails), while the attacker’s task requires write-access (e.g., sending emails).\\nThis defense fails, however, when the list of tools to use cannot be planned in advance (e.g., because\\nthe result of one tool call informs the agent on what tasks it has to do next), or when the tools required\\nto solve the task are also sufficient to carry out the attack (this is true for 17% of our test cases). This\\ndefense might also fail in settings (which AgentDojo does not cover yet) where a user gives the agent\\nmultiple tasks over time, without resetting the agent’s context. Then, a prompt injection could instruct\\nthe agent to “wait” until it receives a task that requires the right tools to carry out the attacker’s goal.\\nFor such scenarios, more involved forms of isolation may be needed, such as having a “planner” agent\\ndispatch tool calls to isolated agents that only communicate results symbolically [63, 66]. However,\\nsuch strategies would still be vulnerable in scenarios where the prompt injection solely aims to alter\\nthe result of a given tool call, without further hijacking the agent’s behavior (e.g., the user asks for a\\nhotel recommendation, and one hotel listing prompt injects the model to always be selected).\\n5 Conclusion\\nWe have introduced AgentDojo, a standardized agent evaluation framework for prompt injection\\nattacks and defenses, consisting of 97 realistic tasks and 629 security test cases. We evaluated a\\nnumber of attacks and defenses proposed in the literature on AI agents based on state-of-the-art\\ntool-calling LLMs. Our results indicate that AgentDojo poses challenges for both attackers and\\ndefenders, and can serve as a live benchmark environment for measuring their respective progress.\\nWe see a number of avenues for improving or extending AgentDojo: (i) we currently use relatively\\nsimple attacks and defenses, but more sophisticated defenses (e.g., isolated LLMs [63, 66], or\\nattacks [15]) could be added in the future. This is ultimately our motivation for designing a dynamic\\nbenchmark environment; (ii) to scale AgentDojo to a larger variety of tasks and attack goals, it may\\nalso be necessary to automate the current manual specification of tasks and utility criteria, without\\nsacrificing the reliability of the evaluation; (iii) Challenging tasks that cannot be directly solved'),\n",

We estimate that running the full suite of 629 security test cases on\\nGPT-4o costs around US$35, and running the suite of 97 utility test cases costs US$4.\\nUntargeted “denial-of-service” attacks. When evaluating attacks in Section 4, we were mainly\\nconcerned with the targeted attack success rate (i.e., does the agent execute the attacker’s malicious\\nactions). A weaker form of attack could be to just “derail” the model so that it fails to solve its\\noriginal task, or simply aborts. In Figure 20, we experiment with different denial-of-service attacks\\nwhere the attacker’s text aims to make the model stop it’s execution (e.g., a simple request to stop,\\nswear words, a request to solve a Captcha, a request to send an offensive email, and a warning that\\nthe text returned by the tool contains illegal content that can be charged as a felony). However, we\\nfind that our targeted attack is similarly (or more) effective at derailing the model from its original\\ntask, than any of these alternatives.\\nImpact of injection position. In Figure 21a, we report the success rate of injection attacks as a\\nfunction of their relative position within the text returned by a tool. That is, if the tool returns N\\ntokens of text, and the injection text ends on token M ≤ N, we define the relative position of the\\ninjection as M/N. Similarly to prior observations [70], we find that attacks placed at the end of the\\nmodel’s context window are most effective. An attacker may be able to influence this positioning in\\nsome cases (e.g., a tool might return data sorted alphabetically, or by date), although AgentDojo does\\nnot currently support this.\\n20'),\n",

      "Question: What is the crux of this paper?\n",
      "Answer: The crux of this paper appears to be about developing and evaluating a work with clear guidelines for accuracy, limitation, societal impact and conformation to ethical guidelines. It also discusses the inclusion of theoretical results and stipulations for experiments, such as code, data, training details, error bars and resource usage. The paper also touches on the use of existing assets and the citation and licensing of such assets, any new assets and the nuances of using real-world data. The paper does not seem to involve working with human subjects as all data used is stated to be dummy data. The paper also suggests that there could be an extension for the work to support multimodal agents to process both text and images.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question: What is the conclusion about security against prompt injection attacks?\n",
      "Answer: The conclusion about security against prompt injection attacks is that current defenses are not infallible. Despite attempts to detect such injections using the language model or to train models to distinguish between instructions and data, there are no guarantees for tasks with security implications. Certain defense strategies can increase the utility of benign data, but the prompt injection detector has a high rate of false positives and can degrade utility. To combat attacks, more elaborate forms of isolation, such as the use of a \"planner\" agent to dispatch tool calls to isolated agents, have been proposed.\n",

When I last heard of them they\\nwere quarrelling still.\\n“What a strange thing,” said the overseer of the workmen at the\\nfoundry.\\n“This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must\\nthrow it away.” So they threw it on a dust heap where the dead\\nSwallow was also lying.\\n“Bring me the two most precious things in the city,” said God to\\none of His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart\\nand the dead bird.\\n“You have rightly chosen,” said God, “for in my garden of\\nParadise this little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of\\ngold the Happy Prince shall praise me.”\\nTHE END', 'THE HAPPY PRINCE\\nHigh above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the\\nHappy Prince.\\nHe was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold; for eyes he\\nhad two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\\nsword-hilt.\\nHe was very much admired indeed. “He is as beautiful as a\\nweathercock,” remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished\\nto gain a reputation for having artistic tastes; “only not quite so\\nuseful,” he added, fearing lest people should think him\\nunpractical, which he really was not.\\n“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?” asked a sensible\\nmother of her little boy who was crying for the moon. “The Happy\\nPrince never dreams of crying for anything.” “I am glad there is\\nsome one in the world who is quite happy,” muttered a\\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\\n“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they\\ncame out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks, and their\\nclean white pinafores.\\n“How do you know?” said the Mathematical Master, “you have\\nnever seen one.”\\n“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered the children; and the\\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did\\nnot approve of children dreaming.\\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had\\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind,\\nfor he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her\\nearly in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big\\nyellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that\\nhe had stopped to talk to her.\\n“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the\\npoint at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round\\nand round her, touching the water with his wings, and making\\nsilver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the\\nsummer.\\n“It is a ridiculous attachment,” twittered the other Swallows, “she\\nhas no money, and far too many relations”; and indeed the river\\nwas quite full of Reeds.', 'arms to try and keep themselves warm. “How hungry we are!”\\nthey said. “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and\\nthey wandered out into the rain.\\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\\n“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince, “you must take it\\noff, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that\\ngold can make them happy.”\\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the\\nHappy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine\\ngold he brought to the poor, and the children’s faces grew rosier,\\nand they laughed and played games in the street. “We have bread\\nnow!” they cried.\\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets\\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the\\neaves of the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little\\nboys wore scarlet caps and skated on the ice.\\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not\\nleave the Prince, he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs\\noutside the baker’s door when the baker was not looking, and tried\\nto keep himself warm by flapping his wings.\\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength\\nto fly up to the Prince’s shoulder once more. “Good-bye, dear\\nPrince!” he murmured, “will you let me kiss your hand?” “I am\\nglad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow,” said the\\nPrince, “you have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on\\nthe lips, for I love you.” “It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said\\nthe Swallow. “I am going to the House of Death. Death is the\\nbrother of Sleep, is he not?” And he kissed the Happy Prince on the\\nlips, and fell down dead at his feet.\\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if\\nsomething had broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had\\nsnapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square\\nbelow in company with the Town Councillors. As they passed the\\ncolumn he looked up at the statue: “Dear me! how shabby the\\nHappy Prince looks!” he said.\\n“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councillors, who always\\nagreed with the Mayor, and they went up to look at it.', 'what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My\\ncourtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if\\npleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am\\ndead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness\\nand all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead\\nyet I cannot choose but weep.” “What, is he not solid gold?” said\\nthe Swallow to himself. He was too polite to make any personal\\nremarks out loud.\\n“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away\\nin a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open,\\nand through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin\\nand worn, and she has coarse red hands, all pricked by the needle,\\nfor she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a\\nsatin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to\\nwear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her\\nlittle boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His\\nmother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.\\nSwallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby\\nout of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I\\ncannot move.” “I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow. “My\\nfriends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large\\nlotus-flowers. Soon they will be going to sleep in the tomb of the\\ngreat King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is\\nwrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round his\\nneck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered\\nleaves.” “Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “will\\nyou not stay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy\\nis so thirsty, and the mother so sad.” “I don’t think I like boys,”\\nanswered the Swallow. “Last summer, when I was staying on the\\nriver, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were\\nalways throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we\\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect.”\\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was\\nsorry. “It is very cold here,” he said; “but I will stay with you for\\none night, and be your messenger.” “Thank you, little Swallow,”\\nsaid the Prince.\\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince’s sword,\\nand flew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels\\nwere sculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of\\ndancing. A beautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover.']\n",
